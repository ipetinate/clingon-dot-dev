# Commands

Commands are ways of interacting with the CLI tool, each command will perform an action, resulting in different outputs, for now we only have one command, but as the tool evolves, new commands will be added

## `gen`

The `gen` command is used to generate resources, it calls the question-based creation flow, where the tool asks you a few things, such as what type of resource, what the framework is, whether you want tests, stories, etc., and in Finally, it gives you the resource files. Remembering that in this mode, the templates are opinionated, based on community code styles (common code between frontend projects, and good practices).

```shell
clingon gen

# or

npx clingon gen
```

## `--version`

Show current version

```shell
clingon --version

# or

npx clingon --version
```

<Callout emoji="😵‍💫">
  This command has unexpected behavior so far, it still takes the last published version and is
  always 1 version behind the current installed one, leading to confusion. It will be fixed soon!
