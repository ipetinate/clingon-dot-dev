# Commands

Commands are ways of interacting with the CLI tool, each command will perform an action, resulting in different outputs, for now we only have one command, but as the tool evolves, new commands will be added

## Anatomy of a command

Understand better how to compose a command using the Clingon API.

First you need to call the tool, if you have installed it globally, you can call it using the word `clingon` if you prefer not to install it globally, use npx as follows `npx clingon`.

```shell
clingon

# or

npx clingon
```

Next, you will have to pass a command, it can be `gen` or `create` (but remember: each one behaves in a different way, see more below in this same documentation). Then:

```shell
clingon gen

# or

npx clingon gen
```

You can add an argument to the command:

```shell
clingon gen MyResourceName

# or

npx clingon MyResourceName
```

And if the command accepts options, you compose it by passing the options with `--OPTION-NAME`, let's use the `create` command as an example:

```shell
clingon gen MyResourceName --preset react-with-test

# or

npx clingon MyResourceName --preset react-with-test
```

    - `--preset`: indicates the `preset` option that takes as its value the name of the preset that you have locally, in this example the name of the preset is `react-with-test` which is a json file saved in the ` folder .clingon/presets` inside your project.

## `gen` command

The `gen` command is used to generate resources, it calls the question-based creation flow, where the tool asks you a few things, such as what type of resource, what the framework is, whether you want tests, stories, etc., and in Finally, it gives you the resource files. Remembering that in this mode, the templates are opinionated, based on community code styles (common code between frontend projects, and good practices).

### Arguments

- `<name>`: Name of the resource to be created (optional).

### Usage examples

- Basic, just call the command and then you answer the questions

```shell
clingon gen


# or

npx clingon gen
```

- With name as argument (same as above, but will skip the name question)

```shell
clingon gen ResourceName

# or

npx clingon gen ResourceName
```

## `create` command

The `create` command is used to create resources with various configurable options, such as resource name, type, framework, file paths, and other additional settings. It facilitates quick and customizable creation of files and structures in a development environment.

This command differs from the `gen` command in a few ways, for example, it is not verbose, so when using Preset Mode, it will create all the resources of your preset instantly, without any messages, interactions or confirmations with the terminal. Saves exceptions where it interacts via prompt in the terminal, if it doesn't find your preset and you have local presets, it will list which one you want to use, or if none exist, it may ask you to answer the prompt for guided generation (but this is in discussion if it is relevant or if it should just return an error, if decided in a future update this documentation will be updated too).

This command has two operating modes: **With presets** or **with parameters (options)**.

- In **preset mode**, you use a locally saved preset to create your resource, it will have all the configuration necessary to assemble the resource, saying whether it needs tests, stories, what style approach, etc.
- In **mode with options**, you indicate each parameter via the command line, if you want typescript, or if you want to use spec or test as a test postfix, or which css approach, to use this mode, you need to have a little more knowledge about the application interfaces to pass the correct values.

### Usage examples

#### Preset mode

Como mencionado anteriormente, o comando `create` possui dois modos, este é o **modo com predefinição**, aqui a ferramenta espera apenas que você indique o argumento `name` e o parâmetro (opção) `--preset` seguida do nome da predefinição (deve ser um nome válido, referente a um arquivo `.json` existente salvo na pasta `.clingon/presets`).

```shell
clingon create ResourceName --preset preset-name

# or

npx clingon create ResourceName --preset preset-name
```

#### Full options mode

- To create with additional options, like adding a test file, using TypeScript, and creating a folder wrapper:

```shell
clingon create ResourceName --preset myPreset --test --typescript --folder-wrapper

# or

npx clingon create ResourceName --preset myPreset --test --typescript --folder-wrapper
```

- To create a Vue component with a story file and a CSS framework:

```shell
clingon create ResourceName --framework vue --story --css-framework css_modules

# or

npx clingon create ResourceName --framework vue --story --css-framework css_modules
```

- To create a resource with a specific framework and type, like a React component:

```shell
clingon create ResourceName --framework react --type component

# or

npx clingon create ResourceName --framework react --type component
```

#### Use as npm script

You can create shortcuts using NPM scripts to execute clingon commands, if you don't want to use presets, or if you want to share commands with your team.

- Create React component with Tests, Story, Vitest, CSS Vanilla and wrapper folder

  - Scripts
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "create:react": "clingon create --type component --framework react --css-framework css_modules --spec --story --path src/components"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Execution

        ```shell
        npm run create:react ResourceName

        # or

        yarn create:react ResourceName
        ```
