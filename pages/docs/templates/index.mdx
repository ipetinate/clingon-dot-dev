## Introduction

Clingon was made to have some operating modes, the one initially implemented was based on answers, or as I usually call it, "guided" mode where it guides you with some questions and at the end gives you the ready-made files.

The big thing is in the pre-populated code, which is ready-made code that you don't have the possibility of changing, they are codes based on common ways in which the community creates components, and some of what I particularly find attractive when it comes to coding style.

Maybe you don't agree with the opinionated template that comes within the files, if that's your case, wait for the next version of the tool, and you'll have the chance to create your own templates and use them in your project.

While this functionality is not ready, you have access to the following templates (listed on the next screen).
