# Presets

In version `0.8.0` the presets feature was added, to save your prompt responses locally, and then quickly use a ready-made set to create your resources.

The feature works as follows: When starting the tool, it will scan the directory where it was run, looking for a folder called `.clingon` and within it another called `presets`, this is the path where the presets are saved` .clingon/presets`. If it doesn't exist, the tool will create the directories, and after answering the questions it will ask if you want to save the answers, and when you answer yes it will finally ask you for the name of the preset (use simple names that indicate what it means, this name will be used later in the listing).

When using presets, it will retrieve all the answers, and will only ask you for the name of the resource, so the last name filled in will not be used, but a new name, keeping only the configuration.
