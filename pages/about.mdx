# About

Hello everything is fine? My name is Isac, I'm from Brazil and I work with frontend software development, and I really like improving the daily development experience, which is why I decided to develop this project.

I hope you find it useful, and that it can save you a lot of time and automate some of your more boring manual tasks during the day.

If you have any functionality tips or want to contribute to the tool, our code is open, and you can send Pull Requests on the tool's GitHub, remember before consulting our contribution guides to have a chance of your PR being approved and merged into the tool .

I [wrote an article](https://dev.to/ipetinate/clingon-the-cli-tool-for-resource-generation-1gfi) on dev.to that explains more about the idea and conception of the tool, [read it](https://dev.to/ipetinate/clingon-the-cli-tool-for-resource-generation-1gfi) there please

## Translations

I haven't translated it into other languages yet, my main language is Portuguese, but I initially chose to document in English due to the ease of international sharing.

In any case, I accept translation contributions, if you are interested, open an Issue on GitHub and we will talk about it. Our doc project uses Nextra, and it makes it possible to have multiple languages in a simple way, so we only need someone to write it.
